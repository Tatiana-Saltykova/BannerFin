            "['Transcript 1\\n', '\\n', 'David (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Good morning, you’re through to David in the Mortgage Advisory team here at Banner. Thank you for clearing our security questions. How can I help you today?\\n', '\\n', 'John (Customer): Hi David – thanks. I’m wondering if we could take a look at the status of my current mortgage and see if there are any options available to change to a new product or just do a review really.\\n', '\\n', 'David (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Certainly, not a problem. Let me just get some details up on my screen here.\\n', '\\n', 'John (Customer): Ok – thanks.\\n', '\\n', 'David (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Ok here we are. So, I can see you’re currently on a 4-year variable mortgage product, with an interest rate of 7.68%. You’ve got another 8 months left on this product and it is portable, so if we wanted to move to another product, that would be possible.\\n', '\\n', 'John (Customer): Yes, that’s right.\\n', '\\n', 'David (Banner Mortgage Advisor): So, were there any specific things you wanted to look into regarding the product – with the current product running out in 8 months are you just trying to get ahead of the curve a bit and see what else is out there?\\n', '\\n', 'John (Customer): Yes – that’s exactly it. I’ve been seeing the way things are going with inflation and to be honest, being on the flexible plan for the past 3 years has been difficult as the interest rate has been going up and down. It’s been hard to keep track of and paying different amounts all the time makes it hard to plan. I’m really concerned about my financial situation and it’s becoming a real challenge to keep on top of. Getting to the point where I’m losing sleep really, and it’s playing on my mind. I think I want something much more short term when it comes to contract length but locks me in to a fixed rate for the term. Just need a bit more financial stability and security at the moment for the next couple of years.\\n', '\\n', 'David (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Understand what you’re saying – makes sense. Let’s take a quick look and see what’s available at the moment for you to potentially port across to.\\n', '\\n', 'Ok so there’s a product here that’s a 2-year contract length. It’s actually a slightly lower interest rate of 4.01% and it’s a fixed term interest rate too. Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?\\n', '\\n', 'John (Customer): That sounds brilliant thanks yes – can we move forward with that please?\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Transcript 2\\n', '\\n', 'Emma (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Hello - you’re through to Emma in the Mortgage Advisory team here at Banner Financial Services. Thanks for going through security. What can I help you with today?\\n', '\\n', 'Mari (Customer): Hello – I’m already a customer of Banner, but all I have with you is a personal loan which I used to get my car. I’m looking for some information on mortgages because I want to buy a house as soon as possible. I’m renting at the moment and my landlord has just put the rent up again for the 3rd time in 3 years. I feel like need to get out of the rent sink-hole and try and get on the property ladder as soon as I can, or I’ll get left behind and stuck where I am.\\n', '\\n', 'Emma (Banner Mortgage Advisor): I understand, yes – thanks for explaining – I’ll happy to help. Have you done any research into mortgage products at all, or do you have an idea of what kind of thing you’d be looking for?\\n', '\\n', 'Mari (Customer): I really haven’t I’m afraid – I don’t know much about mortgages at all, so was hoping you could give me some help.\\n', '\\n', 'Emma (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Of course, I can – so essentially, there are three main types of mortgages – we have Fixed Rate, Variable Rate and Tracker Rate. With a fixed rate mortgage, the cost to you every month is the same – you pay the same amount to the mortgage for the entire length of the contract. With a variable rate mortgage, the amount you pay will go up and down as the rate fluctuates. A tracker mortgage is similar to a variable rate mortgage, but the difference is that it tracks another specified rate from the Bank of England. So, the main two are really fixed and variable.\\n', '\\n', 'Mari (Customer): Ok thank you – I’m thinking the fixed rate may be better, just because I’m a single parent right now and have quite a lot of out-goings each month so I’m having to be quite conscious of my spending and watch it quite closely. Not having something that can go up and down would me more than the potential saving of when it’s low. How long are contracts usually?\\n', '\\n', 'Emma (Banner Mortgage Advisor): There’s quite a lot of room to play with when it comes to contract length – normally between 2 and 5 years – they will come with different interest percentages too, which you’ll need to consider.\\n', '\\n', 'Mari (Customer): Things are a bit up in the air right now so I think it would make sense for me to pick a shorter contract, just so I’m not tied down to anything for too long, in case my situation changes.\\n', '\\n', 'Emma (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Sure thing – that makes sense considering what you’ve mentioned. What I can do is take a look and see if there are any products that are available and try to find something with the lowest interest rates possible for you to try and keep the repayments as low as we can.\\n', '\\n', 'Mari (Customer): Yes, that would be great – thank you.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Transcript 3\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Hi – this is Shaun Pace calling from the Banner Mortgage Advisory team, could I speak to Claire Wallace please?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Hello, yes – speaking.\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Hello Claire, good to speak with you – I’m calling just to reach out and see if there’s any assistance, we can provide you concerning your current mortgage product which, as I can see here, is due to expire in 3 months’ time?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Oh okay – right – yes, I saw an email you sent earlier this week, I’d been meaning to drop you a line back, sorry Shaun.\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Not a problem at all – is it a convenient time for us to have a quick chat now?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Yes, that’s fine – thanks.\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Before we jump in, can I just run through some security questions please?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Yep, no problem.\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Ok – could you please let me know your date of birth, the first line of your address and the email we hold on the system for you?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Yes – 6th February 1990, address is 41 Hawes Crescent, and the email address is claire3wall6@outlook.com \\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): That’s fantastic – thank you for clearing security for me there. So, as I mentioned – your current mortgage contract is due to expire in 3 months’ time, and at the end of this period your fixed rate of 6.98% will jump to a 8.41% variable rate for the foreseeable future – so we normally recommend we review what other products may be available for you and try to secure another contract and keep the interest rate low.\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Yes absolutely – this current product was locked in for 5 years on a fixed rate and I don’t really want to change that, I don’t want to move to a variable rate just because it’s too unstable. I’d like to find another fixed rate, and depending on the difference between the interest numbers, ideally fix it for another 5 years.\\n', '\\n', 'Shaun (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Ok – no problem at all, I can take a look and see what comes back for you to switch to once your current contract runs out. I can see a product here that’s got a contract length of 5 years and the interest rate is a tiny bit lower than your current one at 6.78%. Does that sound good to you?\\n', '\\n', 'Claire (Customer): Yes – that sounds good – let’s go with that, thanks.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Transcript 4 \\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Hi – this is Jess calling from the Banner Mortgage Advisory team, could I please speak with James Jonas?\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): Hi there, yes that’s me.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Hi James, I’m just calling today to offer any assistance we may be able to give you regarding your current mortgage product which, is due to run out in about 3 months’ time?\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): Oh yes cheers – did you send an email the other day?\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): That’s right we did.\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): That’s right – I was talking with our union rep about this at work actually – just speaking about looking at this kind of with everything going on under the Tories at the moment. I’ve just had some of my disability benefits reduced too, so things are starting to get a bit more difficult money-wise.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): I see, oh, well I’m sorry to hear that – hopefully we might be able to help out and perhaps get you a better contract with lower rates.\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): That would be brilliant, thanks.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Do you have a moment to talk now?\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): Yeah – go ahead.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Ok thanks – I’m just going to run through our security questions first. Could you please let me know your date of birth, your postcode and your phone number?\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): 16th December 1974, BD8 0EH is the postcode and my number is 07998652363.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): That’s great – thanks for clearing security. So, your current mortgage contract is due to expire in just over 3 months’ time, and at the end of this period your fixed rate of 7.21% will jump to a 9.21% variable rate. What we can do is see if there are any other products available for you – as I’m guessing you don’t want to jump to a higher interest rate and to a variable product?\\n', '\\n', 'James (Customer): Yeah, that’s right, I don’t want to be on variable, it’s too up and down at the minute, no idea what we’ll end up paying. I’d like to be on a fixed for at least 2 years.\\n', '\\n', 'Jess (Banner Mortgage Advisor): Ok then, let’s see what comes back. There’s one here with your current lender that is for a contract length of 2 years and the interest rate is only 4.56%. Have you had any issues at all with your current lender?\\n', 'James (Customer): No, they’ve been fine – they’re actually my bank Barclays, so I’ve got all my bank accounts and a loan out with them too. Can we go ahead with that one?\\n']\n"
